# Shope-Image-Classification
Notebook detailing my approach to rank Top 2% out of ~900 teams during the Image Classification segment of the Shopee Code Leage 2020, achieving 83% top-1 accuracy. This was a challenging competition where we were given barely 2 weeks. This was my first Computer Vision competition, and I learnt fast.ai from scratch during this competition. I used a pretrained EfficientNet-B4 with a variety of SOTA augmentation techniques and a couple of training tricks to push the accuracy. 

I tried my best to explain the most important techniques I used. Still, some details are omitted for conciseness. I tried many things during the competition and learnt a lot. Feel free to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/minhtoo/">reach out to me on LinkedIn</a> for a discussion, or perhaps to collaborate on an AI project!

I also thank my teammate, Benjamin Chew, for kickstarting the initial fast.ai experiments and exposing me to the beauty of fast.ai!!
