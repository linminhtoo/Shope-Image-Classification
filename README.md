# Shope-Image-Classification
Notebook detailing my approach to rank Top 2% out of ~900 teams during the Image Classification segment of the Shopee Code Leage 2020, achieving 83% top-1 accuracy. I used fast.ai using a pretrained EfficientNet-B4 with a variety of SOTA augmentation techniques and a couple of training tricks to push the accuracy.
